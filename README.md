# Flame of Limited Life
A datapack for minecraft enabling play of a game similar to Grian's Limited Life, initially created for the Flame of Life group

# Initial Set up

1. Find a seed you like where it has a good play area WITHIN 2000 blocks of spawn (some datapack features are buggy farther away from spawn). Small biomes highly recommended.
2. Set desired world border size and location using the worldborder command.
3. Copy the "FlameOfLimitedLife" folder from this repository into your datapacks folder.
4. Invite all the friends you want to be in the game
5. run ```/function foll_limited:setup_players```
