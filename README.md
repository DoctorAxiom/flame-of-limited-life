# Flame of Limited Life
A datapack for minecraft enabling play of a game similar to Grian's Limited Life, initially created for the Flame of Life gaming group.

Please note this is currently a Work In Progress. you're not going to a full game out of this yet if you download and install it.

# Initial Set up

1. Find a seed you like where it has a good play area WITHIN 5000 blocks of spawn (some datapack features are buggy farther away from spawn).
2. Set desired world border size and location using the worldborder command.
3. Highly recommend ```/gamerule keep_inventory true``` on for this game.
3. Copy the "FlameOfLimitedLife" folder from this repository into your datapacks folder.
4. Invite all the friends you want to be in the game
5. run ```/function foll_limited:setup_players```
